          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I've taught more than 1,000 Korean English learners and helped them
            move from understanding English to actually speaking it with
            confidence, clarity, and a sense of connection.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I help learners who've studied hard for years but still feel stuck
            when it's time to talk. If that's you, you're not alone. Maybe
            you've tried to memorize every grammar rule, or you keep
            second-guessing yourself: “Is this English natural… or is it
            Konglish?”
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            With two Master's degrees and a background from Georgetown
            University, I bring academic experience, and more importantly, real
            empathy. I understand the pressure to “get it right,” the leftover
            hagwon habits, and the hesitation that comes from years of focusing
            on tests instead of conversations.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            That's why I created this course: to help you finally speak up, feel
            heard, and enjoy using English in your real life.
